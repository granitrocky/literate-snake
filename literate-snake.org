* Purpose
  This document is an attempt at putting a complete Bevy game and Design Document in a single file.

  We will be creating a document based on [[https://mbuffett.com/posts/bevy-snake-tutorial/][this tutorial]]

** Why?
   The reason for this workflow is to keep all our documentation and code in a single place. It's practice for creating a living org doc that will be my standard for creating projects in the future.

   That is, the code for this project is pulled directly from this document using ~org-babel~
